# Privacy Policy

1. I do not (and will never) sell, license, sub-license or share any of the data submitted directly or indirectly by the end-users with any person or entity.
2. When the service comes into contact with user data, it is discarded as quickly as possible.
3. I endeavour to protect end-users from privacy exposure to other services that this service must interact with in order to operate properly.
For example, we enforce Query Name Minimisation and we do not forward our users IP subnets to the authoritative name servers when EDNS Client Subnet has been disabled.
